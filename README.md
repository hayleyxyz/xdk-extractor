# XDK Extractor

This program extracts all .cab files from XDKRecoveryXenonXXXX.exe and XDKSetupXenonXXXX.exe files, which you can then extract with another tool (7-Zip) to get all contents.

7-Zip seemingly already has the functionality to open setup .exe's like these and extract their contents, however 7-Zip only looks at the first .cab entry in the file, which doesn't give you all of the files you'd want. This program will extract all .cab entries.
